# PHISHING-DETECTION-URL-USING-NLP-AND-MACHINE-LEARNING-
MINI PROJECT
#Project Overview
This project aims to detect phishing URLs using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). By analyzing various features of a URL — such as its structure, content tokens, and entropy — the system classifies URLs as either phishing or legitimate.

⚙️ Key Features
Preprocessing of URLs for feature extraction (length, symbols, digits, entropy)

TF-IDF Vectorization for NLP-based feature representation

Model training using Random Forest Classifier

Flask-based backend for ML model serving

HTML frontend for user input and result display

🛠️ Tech Stack
🐍 Python 3.8+

📦 Scikit-learn

🌐 Flask (Backend API)

🖥️ HTML/CSS (Frontend)

🧪 Jupyter Notebook (Model Training & Testing)

🎯 Objective
To develop a web-based phishing detection system that classifies suspicious URLs by leveraging machine learning techniques on both structural and textual features.

🚀 Results
The system achieves high accuracy and can be easily extended with additional classifiers or datasets to improve performance.
